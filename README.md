# Hi, welcome to my youtube song dowloader
Well, this is just a personal project that I made using pytube to just download some youtube songs
using an txt file

# how use this?
## First of all, you need python
python - install (here)[https://www.python.org/downloads/] I think

## Now just put all your songs in the txt musicList.txt
that's all, just run the main.py an only song will download

# Disclaimer
Well, the pytube don't convert mp4 to mp3 and I wont install library to do that, because it's more one dependency you need to install, so I just did a "gambiarra" ( technical adjustment ) to just split the filename and put .mp3 in end, but I think this will work, if not, please make a issue
